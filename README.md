## Resources

Many exercises and lecture materials are in form of Jupyter notebooks with **.ipynb** extensions. Sometimes GitHub may not load them correctly for preview, then you can use [Open in Colab][colab_addon], which is an addon in Chrome to open the notebook in Colab. Alternatively, you can go to [jupyter nbviewer][nbviewer], and paste the link to the notebook for previewing. When working with exercises it is important that you create your own notebooks (.ipynb) or script files (.py).
